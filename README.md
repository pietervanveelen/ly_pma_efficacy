## Propidium monoazide pre-treatment of membrane filtered water samples enables molecular assessment of bacterial survival

This analysis workflow covers the data analysis and results of three experiments reported by Ly et al. 2024, in which the efficacy of propidium monoazide (PMA) pre-treatment on membrane filtered water samples is validated for the quantitative assessment of bacterial survival using qPCR. The method is applied to Gram positive and negative species (Exp. I), at different starting concentrations of *E. coli* (Exp. II), and tested in an advanced wastewater treatment setting via wastewater treatment plant effluent treated in an ozonation reactor. Bacterial survival estimates were compared for PMA-qPCR, conventional qPCR (tested as a blank PBS control pre-treatment without PMA) and with culture based determination of bacterial abundances (Exp. III) of susceptible *E. coli* and relatively ozone resistant *P. aeruginosa* spiked to effluent prior to treatment.
